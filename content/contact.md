For inquiries about my work, writings, games, etc., or if you wish to ask a question for me to publicly answer on this blog, please contact me via the following methods:
- e-mail: inquiries@chapien.net

If you just want to chat, you can also try and reach me through social media. That said, please don't expect me to necessarily be your friend, but I'll at least try to respond to messages directed to me:
- tumblr: https://chappydev.tumblr.com/
- bsky: https://bsky.app/profile/claire.chapien.net

If you have a question about a game I've made available on itch.io, please reach out to me on that platform.
- itch.io: https://chapien.itch.io/

If you want to send me money as a donation, you can do so at:
- ko-fi: https://ko-fi.com/chapien

Finally, if you want to find all public facing social media accounts I have, you can find them at my linktree:
- links: https://tree.chapien.net/

Please do not reach out to me via Facebook or LinkedIn, unless I know you in person or you are in the Game Industry and have a professional inquiry. I have not posted links to those profiles anywhere on this site because I value some measure of privacy, no matter how thin.
