The website's theme is a fork of [Redstrate's](https://redstrate.com/) Hugo theme. Though the theme was specific to their website, in the files it was named 'red'. So, I've cleverly named my variant of the theme [blue](https://github.com/Chapien/blue), which is also under the [MIT License](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Chapien/blue/refs/heads/main/LICENSE). Redstrate was extremely helpful in the process of porting their theme, so please give their website a look!
