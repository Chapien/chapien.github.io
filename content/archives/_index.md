A page to hold archived works from other places. All works posted here are either public domain, licensed under some sort of CC-BY license, or posted with permission. 

Works I host here are ones that I worry are at risk of being lost or censored. Archiving them here does not mean I support or agree with the content. I will try to preface each work with my reason for archiving it.
