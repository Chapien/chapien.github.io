A page to hold archived works from other places. All works posted here are either public domain, licensed under some sort of CC-BY license, or posted with permission.

Works I host here are ones that I worry are at risk of being lost or censored. Archiving them here does not mean I support or agree with the content. I will try to preface each work with my reason for archiving it.

If you see content here that belongs to you and you want it removed, or if you have content that you want me to mirror, please send me an e-mail: inquiries@chapien.net.
