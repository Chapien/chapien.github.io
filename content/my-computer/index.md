# Software
## Operating Systems
My primary computer is a desktop running [Fedora Linux 42 Workstation KDE Edition](https://fedoraproject.org/kde/). Previously, I used Windows almost exlcusively, though I have always used Linux off and on for school, work and other things. I made the switch full-time to Linux in January of 2025, after the EOL of Windows 10 was announced. As Microsoft became a worse and worse company, and Desktop Linux became more and more viable, I decided to make the switch full time. I started off with [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/), which helped me learn a lot about Linux, but I've now settled in comfortably with Fedora.

On my laptop and Steam Deck, I use [Bazzite](https://bazzite.gg/) with KDE Plasma. For work, I have a Mac Mini M1.

## Development Environment
I primarily use [VSCodium](https://vscodium.com/). I like Visual Studio Code, but I wanted to get away from Microsoft's telemetry as much as possible. I've enabled Microsoft extensions on VSCodium, but I try to avoid them when I can. If I absolutely need a VS Code feature, I still have it installed, but I avoid using it where I can.

If I'm making lightweight changes, usually on my server or with config files, I use [helix](https://helix-editor.com/). That said, I'm still new to modal editors, and I have absolutely no idea what I am doing.

My preferred terminal is [Alacritty](https://alacritty.org/) with [zsh](https://www.zsh.org/) and [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki).

For game development, my preferred engine is [Godot](https://godotengine.org/), which I have been using since Godot 3. I also have experience with [Unreal](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US) and [Unity](https://unity.com/), but I strongly prefer working in Godot to Unity. I got my start as a child with [GameMaker](https://gamemaker.io/en) and [RPG Maker XP](https://www.rpgmakerweb.com/products/rpg-maker-xp). While I no longer use GameMaker, I occasionally return to RPG Maker, usually [RPG Maker MZ](https://www.rpgmakerweb.com/products/rpg-maker-mz). I really enjoy the RPG Maker ecosystem, and I am hopeful that they follow the lead of [Action Game Maker](https://godotengine.org/showcase/action-game-maker/) and make a Godot plugin to replace their Unity plugin.

## Multimedia
I listen to music using the [Strawberry Music Player](https://www.strawberrymusicplayer.org/). For videos and any formats that Strawberry cannot play, I fall back to the old reliable [VLC](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/). I listen to podcasts via RSS feeds with [Kasts](https://apps.kde.org/kasts/). I view images with [Gwenview](https://apps.kde.org/gwenview/), and my preferred PDF reader is [Okular](https://okular.kde.org/) for lightweight use and [PDF4Qt](https://jakubmelka.github.io/) for anything that Okular cannot handle.

## Multimedia Editing
I oscillate between [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/) and [Krita](https://krita.org/en/), depending on what exactly I am doing. I rarely do anything with audio, but when I do, I usually just use [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/). As with audio, I usually do not edit videos, but when I do, I just use [kdenlive](https://kdenlive.org/).

## Office
For documents, spreadsheets, and so on, I use [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/). For e-mails, RSS feeds, and calendars, I use [Betterbird](https://www.betterbird.eu/). I do not use Google Calendar; all of my caldavs and contacts are stored on my own server using [Radicale](https://radicale.org/v3.html). 

For note taking, brainstorming, flowchart creation, some scheduling and pretty much everything, I use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). It's a wonderful program that I encourage everyone to try out. That said, I've recently had some performance issues, so please be cautious not to install too many plugins like I have!

For writing Markdown files outside of Obsidian, I use [Typora](https://typora.io/). It's not FOSS, unfortunately, but it's the best one I've managed to find that uses live previews. WYSIWYG is vital for me for any Markdown editor.
