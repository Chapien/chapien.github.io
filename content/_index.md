Hello there! My name is Claire, also known as chapien online. I'm a game developer who has worked primarily on ports throughout my time in the industry, and an aspiring writer. I'm hoping to have this website serve as a central place for all of my work to be collected and tracked.

Here, you'll find [blog](blog) posts about a myriad of topics ranging from software engineering, politics, LGBT issues, and mental health. I'm rather opinionated, and I will state outright that I am quite left-leaning politically. I do not ask that you agree with me, only that you approach my works with respect.

In addition to blog posts, I'm hoping to post short stories as well as updates on games I'm developing. Watch this space!
