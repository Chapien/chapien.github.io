[{"content":"About the Author Who are you? My name is Claire. I\u0026rsquo;m an asexual trans woman with a passion for video games, history, and writing. I\u0026rsquo;m around 30 years old (+/-, depending on when you\u0026rsquo;re reading). I\u0026rsquo;m a game developer as well as a hobbyist writer. It\u0026rsquo;s not particularly hard to find out more about me, but I prefer to keep at least some separation between my real life and online life, and so I won\u0026rsquo;t share my last name here. If you are in the industry and want to contact me, you likely have means of finding my LinkedIn, though you can also contact me through any of the available methods on my contact page for inquiries.\nYou\u0026rsquo;re a Game Developer? Yeah! I went to college for computer science and game design. I didn\u0026rsquo;t finish my degree due to real life circumstances, but thanks to the connections I built I managed to get a job regardless. I\u0026rsquo;ve worked primarily on ports and smaller scale projects. Again, if you\u0026rsquo;re in the industry, you can find my LinkedIn fairly easily I think. For those that aren\u0026rsquo;t, I worked for a company that was essentially contracted by larger companies to assist with ports, updates to old games, or specific tasks on larger projects. A few games I worked on with them were Age of Empires Anniversary Edition and Bard\u0026rsquo;s Tale Trilogy Remastered.\nUnfortunately, the game industry has had a large downturn recently, meaning not many studios are looking for contractors. I was furloughed back in August of 2024, and remain between jobs at the moment. Should my former boss have work for me, I will return to my previous job, provided I haven\u0026rsquo;t found a job before then.\nDespite this, I am still working on independent game projects. Mostly just experiments and exercises to keep my skills sharp, but maybe something will come of it. If I do plan on releasing a game, I\u0026rsquo;ll doubtless talk about it here (and thus dox myself anyway, c\u0026rsquo;est la vie).\nWhat else do you do? I post online a lot. You can check out my Bluesky where I resist the urge to argue with people (I\u0026rsquo;m working on it). If you want more inane ramblings, I post longer form stuff on Tumblr. Basically anything that I don\u0026rsquo;t spend enough time thinking about to post here, ends up there, so check it out for that sort of nonsense.\nI enjoy playing video games. I don\u0026rsquo;t think anyone goes into game development without at least enjoying video games at the start, though some may come to hate it. My favorite genres are Strategy Games, RPGs, and MMOs. Some of my most played games on Steam are Total War: Warhammer, Stellaris, and Skyrim. My favorite games include Morrowind, Caves of Qud, Dwarf Fortress, and Crusader Kings 3. That said, the only games I play daily are MMORPGs; currently, I am active on Elder Scrolls Online and Final Fantasy XIV.\nI also end up roleplaying a lot. That is, inserting myself into a character and pretending to be them. I inevitably do this on every MMORPG I play (in different capacities), but I also do it in other contexts. I\u0026rsquo;m in several TTRPG groups, both as a player and a game master, with my favorite TTRPGs being Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay 4th Edition and Pathfinder 2nd Edition. I enjoy the Forgotten Realms setting greatly, but have fallen out of love with Dungeons and Dragons itself. I got my start roleplaying on forums, in the early 2000s, when I was probably way too young to have unsupervised internet access, but such is the late-born Millenial state of being. I also roleplay through private chats with friends. Read into that what you will.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve also had a passion for writing most of my life. I\u0026rsquo;ve written stories since I was very young, creating imaginary worlds, gods, characters and so on. Despite this, I\u0026rsquo;ve never actually published anything (aside from a work on now defunct website when I was younger), unless you count social media posts with barely any thought to be \u0026ldquo;publishing\u0026rdquo;. I want to change that, so I\u0026rsquo;ve begun writing fiction. This includes both original works and fan fiction. Some of the ones I am most proud of might end up posted here (or at least links to them), but if you want to find all of them, you can find links to my work on my Tumblr. I believe in you.\nYou\u0026rsquo;re asexual? Transgender? Why share that? Yep, sure am. They\u0026rsquo;re just a part of who I am, and while I don\u0026rsquo;t want this to be a blog exclusively about queer rights, it may inevitably come up. Just thought you should know. I\u0026rsquo;m sure that\u0026rsquo;s fine with you though, yeah?\nAbout this Website What sort of content will be posted here? All sorts of stuff, really! Longform isn\u0026rsquo;t necessarily the right word, as I can see myself writing shorter content here. Rather, think of this as the place where I post things that I\u0026rsquo;ve thought through. You know, things that have passed through an editor, that I\u0026rsquo;ve reread, worked on for a few days, stuff like that.\nAre there any Content Warnings? Most of my work here should be fine to view anywhere and by anyone. That said, I\u0026rsquo;m writing for an audience of adults, and that should be kept in mind. Since this is meant to be a somewhat professional environment, I\u0026rsquo;m going to avoid talking about more explicit topics where I can. That said, if something interests me enough to write about it, it may end up here. Rest assured that anything that one might find upsetting or erotic will be tagged, with appropriate warnings in the title and description.\nWhat if I want to see your unrefined writing? An excellent question. If you want short form, random chatting with strangers, you can check out my Bluesky. For longer form stuff, but still seat-of-the-pants, you can check out my Tumblr. That said, neither are spaces I am comfortable with minors. Only go to my social media accounts if you are over 18 (and to be honest, you shouldn\u0026rsquo;t even be here if you are under 18). And, for the sake of my own personal comfort, do not directly interact with me on social media unless you are 21 or older. Thanks for understanding.\nWhat about your stories? All of the stories I write that are not fanfiction and are not inappropriate will be posted here. They will likely not be hosted here, mind you; rather, I will make a blog post with a brief summary, which will include a link to wherever I have decided to host any given fic. Some of my more refined fanfiction could also end up here; I enjoy writing apocrypha (or non-canon, in-universe texts) for the Elder Scrolls setting, and this feels a fine enough place to promote that.\nWhat if I want to see your\u0026hellip; other stories? Yeesh. You can find links to my AO3 on my Tumblr. You\u0026rsquo;ll find fanfiction there, both safe and unsafe for work. And if you want to see me talk about my process with those works, you can probably find it somewhere on my Tumblr.\nIs it all stories? Not at all! I will also post my opinions on video games, other people\u0026rsquo;s works, things I enjoy, politics when I can stomach it, queer stuff when I feel like it, and really anything that comes to mind that I care enough to write about.\nWhat about Game Development stuff? I might occasionally post on game development topics. If I ever start working on a personal project I want to make public, I might detail it here. Industry news will also come up, but I\u0026rsquo;m not really the best at giving advice with regard to coding, breaking into the industry, and so on. Still, if I think I have something to say, I\u0026rsquo;ll say it.\nDid you honestly expect anyone to read this entire page? Well, I mean.
